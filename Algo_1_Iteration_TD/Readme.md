# RL_From_Scratch

Welcome to **RL_From_Scratch**, a project dedicated to implementing Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms **from the ground up**. This repository is designed to help learners understand the core logic and implementation of RL methods through clean, well-structured Python code.

## 📌 Current Progress: Algorithm Category 1 - Iteration Methods

The first category implemented in this repository is **Iteration Methods**, which includes two foundational Dynamic Programming techniques:

- **Policy Iteration**
- **Value Iteration**

These methods are designed for environments where a full model (transition probabilities and rewards) is available — i.e., known Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

📁 Directory: `Algo1_Iteration/`

Each algorithm comes with:
- Core implementation in Python
- Sample environment (e.g., GridWorld)
- Step-by-step comments and explanations
- (Optional) Visualization support

## 🔧 Requirements

This project uses Python and requires the following dependencies:

```bash
python >= 3.7
numpy
matplotlib   # (Optional, for visualization)
